## Understanding Inflation in Canada: Affordability, Financial Strain, and Economic Stability
*A Decision Intelligence Analysis of Inflation in Canada*

# Executive Summary
This study analyzes inflation trends in Canada through the lens of Consumer Price Index (CPI) growth, wage growth reports, housing affordability, and monetary policies. Using comprehensive datasets from Statistics Canada, the Bank of Canada, and CMHC, I plan to examine how inflation affects affordability in different economic sectors and whether current monetary policies are effective in maintaining price stability. By analyzing these datasets, this research aims to provide insights into the long-term economic implications of inflation in Canada and offer data-driven recommendations for policymakers, businesses, and individuals.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Consumer Price Index (CPI) Growth Rate
- Measures the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over a specified period (monthly or yearly).
-  CPI is the primary indicator of inflation, showing how the average price level of a basket of goods and services changes over time.
2. Core Inflation Rate
-  Inflation rate that excludes volatile items such as food and energy prices.
- provides a more stable view of inflation trends by removing short-term price fluctuations.
3. Purchasing Power of the Canadian Dollar
- Measures how much the value of the Canadian dollar has changed over time in terms of its ability to purchase goods and services.
- Helps assess the real impact of inflation on consumers and businesses.
4. Interest Rate (Bank of Canada Policy Rate)
- The rate at which the Bank of Canada lends to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs across the economy.
- Inflation and interest rates are closely linked. The Bank of Canada adjusts interest rates to control inflationâ€”raising rates to slow inflation and lowering them to stimulate growth.
5. Wage Growth vs. Inflation Rate
- Compares the growth in average wages to the inflation rate to determine if wages are keeping up with rising costs.
- If wages grow slower than inflation, consumers lose purchasing power, leading to reduced economic well-being.
