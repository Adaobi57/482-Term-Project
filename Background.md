## Problem Context: 
Inflation is a critical economic indicator that affects the purchasing power of consumers, business investment decisions, and government policy-making. In recent years, inflation in Canada has fluctuated due to various global and domestic factors, including supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand, and monetary policy adjustments by the Bank of Canada [[1]](#1). According to Statistics Canada the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.4% on average in 2024, with essential goods such as food, housing, and transportation experiencing significant price shifts [[2]](#2).  While inflation has eased compared to previous years, many Canadians continue to face financial strain, with nearly 3 in 4 Canadians reporting that rising prices are affecting their ability to meet day-to-day expenses [[3]](#3).
Additionally, interest rate decisions by the Bank of Canada, which aims to keep inflation within its 1-3% target range, play a crucial role in economic stability. As of late 2024, inflation was reported at 1.9%, signaling a return to stability, but concerns about affordability persist, particularly in the housing sector. Housing costs, mortgage rates, and rental prices remain a major concern for many Canadians, with affordability decreasing in major cities despite inflationary stabilization [[4]](#4).  Furthermore, wage growth has not kept pace with rising costs, leading to a decline in real wages and overall purchasing power [[5]](#5).
## Significance of Studying Inflation in Canada

This analysis is significant for various reasons:

1. Helps economic policy decision-making by the Bank of Canda and government agencies to determine appropriate monetary policies such as adjusting interest rates to control inflation and curbing government spending to maintain economic stability.

2. Cost of Living Analysis
- Provides insights into how inflation impacts the purchasing power of Canadians, helping citizens and policymakers understand changes in the cost of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.
- Can inform minimum wage adjustments to ensure earnings keep pace with inflation.
3. Housing Market and Interest Rate Impact
- Inflation trends influence mortgage rates and overall housing affordability.
- Helps potential homeowners and renters make informed financial decisions.
4. Public Awareness and Financial Planning
- Educates the general public on the impact of inflation, and helping individuals make better financial and savings decisions.
- Encourages responsible debt management, especially when inflation affects interest rates on loans and credit.

## Research Objectives 

This study aims to:
1.	To analyze the historical trends of inflation in Canada over the past decade and identify periods of high and low inflation and the factors contributing to these changes.
2.	To evaluate how inflation affects affordability of essential goods and services such as food, housing, and transportation.
3.	To analyze the impact of the Bank of Canada’s interest rate decisions on inflation levels and assess the effectiveness of monetary policy tools in stabilizing inflation.
4.	To explore how inflation correlates with GDP growth, employment rates, and consumer spending.
5.	To predict future inflation rates.
