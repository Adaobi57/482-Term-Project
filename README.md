The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a vital Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for understanding inflation trends and their impact on economic stability in Canada.

<!-- consider writing a brief paragraph like the one above ^^ that emphasizes the potential value of looking at this measurement. We want to convey awareness of the business value of this measure and our ability to take a macro view -->

Summary details:

- Measures the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over a specified period (monthly or yearly).   
- CPI is the primary indicator of inflation, showing how the average price level of a basket of goods and services changes over time.

### Core Inflation Rate
- Inflation rate that excludes volatile items such as food and energy prices.
- Provides a more stable view of inflation trends by removing short-term price fluctuations.

### Purchasing Power of the Canadian Dollar
 - Measures how much the value of the Canadian dollar has changed over time in terms of its ability to purchase goods and services.
- Helps assess the real impact of inflation on consumers and businesses.

### Wage Growth vs. Inflation Rate
- Compares the growth in average wages to the inflation rate to determine if wages are keeping up with rising costs.
- If wages grow slower than inflation, consumers lose purchasing power, leading to reduced economic well-being.
